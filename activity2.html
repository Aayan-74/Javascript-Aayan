    It then logs a birthday song to the console, including the user's name and age.

    inside the brackets of happyBirthday("Shai Gilgeous-Alexander", 24); are arguments that are passed to the function when it is called.
    The function will then use these arguments to fill in the placeholders in the console logs.
